# Intro to Processor Architecture - Project (Spring 2024)

## Specifications

The required specifications in the processor design are as follows:

- A full fledged processor architecture implementation with 5 stage pipeline which includes support for eliminating pipeline hazards. 


### Important points to notice:
- Both the above implementations must execute all the instructions from Y86 ISA except **call** and **ret** instructions to get the above-mentioned marks. If you also execute **call** and **ret** instructions, additional marks will be awarded.
- The file includes test cases written in assembly to test all the program functionality
